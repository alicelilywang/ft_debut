1. In the most concise way possible, answer this question, what is 42? How would you describe 42 to someone who doesn’t know what 42 is?

42 is an innovative, non-profit, tuition-free software engineering school that has no teachers and no classes, and the students can complete projects at their own pace with the help of 42's peer-learning pedagogy. 

2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

Having no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests is a way to test the student's ability to be patient, problem solve, and think intuitively, independently and creatively which are important skills as a potential programmer. Furthermore, there will be no language barrier so everybody has a fair chance regardless of background.

3. What are the core 42 principles?

Learning to learn, pursuit of excellence, respecting others, creativity and passion, belief of open opportunities, being unafraid of failing, being both independent and gaining soft skills through peer-to-peer collaboration. 

4. If somebody is thinking of going to 42, but has no coding experience - do you really think it’s worth their time?

As someone who had no coding experience before 42, I highly recommend it - not only am I learning to code at an accelerated pace, I'm also learning many other useful skills such as confronting fears of failure and figuring problems out on my own. It is also a place to meet a diverse range of people of all ages, ethnicities and stories so it's a great place to meet people and make friends.

5. What makes 42 unique?

42 has no classes or teachers and provides gamification in the curriculum. This allows students who struggled with traditional educational structures or rigid systems to thrive. Furthermore, in order to succeed in this school, the student must be extremely self-motivated and passionate about programming.
42 has no tuition and has free accommodation which gives people from a diverse range of backgrounds, grades and socio-economic status an opportunity to learn programming and experience quality education, which sets 42 apart from universities and coding bootcamps. 
42 values a flexible project-based curriculum and peer-learning, and teaches a broad range of programming languages, both low-level and high-level to provide a rounded, comprehensive understanding. Students learn the fundamentals at their own pace and schedule, and with the additional help of knowledgeable student mentors, they can master the skills needed for the industry and become fully prepared and motivated when they seek their first job.
Furthermore, it is a small school with french roots due to founder Xavier Niel's education philosophy so it feels different to traditional American schools.

6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

It is a full on learning experience for both essential life skills and programming. Being at 42 pushes you to learn time-management, soft skills, self-discipline due to the lack of time constraints. But most of all 42 teaches me to think like a programmer and solve problems in a cohesive, logical manner.

7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

I will try to break down the problem into manageable chunks, or view the problem from another perspective by drawing it out or writing pseudocode. If I don't understand a particular base concept, I will try to educate myself using online resources such as Stack Overflow. If I still do not understand after a considerable amount of time, I will ask someone who has already completed the problem, or has more experience in programming. 

8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high on a daily basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine pressure and strict dead- lines?

I will remind myself that I am here to learn and grow as both a future programmer and a person, and being here in itself is a incredible privilege. It would be a shame to waste such an amazing learning opportunity with one's poor work ethics and lack of motivation.

9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website, but they do not offer job placement, what would you say?

42's learning philosophy pushes students to be resourceful and learn about how the job market works. Thus, 42 does not guarantee job placement, but instead provides a supportive, helpful environment where there are plenty of opportunities to pursue, but where the student is strongly encouraged to find and discover jobs of interest on their own.

10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a certain level before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime you find one?

Once a student reaches the first third of their learning experienc (ie. at least level 7 on the curriculum), they are encouraged to find an internship through networking with companies through get-togethers, hackathons and conferences in order to advance their curriculum. However, if a student feels ready, they have the freedom to find an internship on their own accord and leave at any time. Experiencing company projects in a workplace environment helps students acquire essential skills to implement in their future programming jobs.

11. How does 42 help you adapt to a work place?

At 42, students spend hours working on projects, working in groups and working in an environment that teaches both hard and soft skills. The nature of 42's program teaches students how to learn, how to be resourceful, ask other people for help, and how to problem solve. This makes the transition to a workplace natural and effortless.
